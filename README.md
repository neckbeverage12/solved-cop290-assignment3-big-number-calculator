 <li>In this assignment, you have to implement Arithmetic Operations for a very large number (Even larger than long long int).</li>

 <li>Basic operations which are needed to be implemented are: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.</li>

 <li>Other operations includes: square root, Absolute value and power.</li>

 <li>Programming languages allowed are ANSI-C and C++.</li>

 <li>You are only allowed to use stdio, string and other libraries which inherently doesn’t implement big number library.</li>

 <li>Your submission should contain a zipped folder whose name is your entry number and should contain the folder having all the .c /.cpp files and a makefile.

  <ul>

   <li>g. Your submission will have a zip folder(2018MCS2018.zip) which contains another folder(2018MCS2018) having all codes and makefile</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Your main executable should be named as mainfile which is made by make command.</li>

 <li>mainfile should take two command line arguments i.e. &lt;Name of Input file&gt; and &lt;Name of</li>

</ul>

Output file&gt;

<ul>

 <li>Your code should run like<em>: ./mainfile   txt   output.txt </em></li>

</ul>

<ul>

 <li><strong>txt</strong> (i.e. the input file) will contain the different queries, corresponding to each arithmetic operations.</li>

 <li><strong>Query Format: </strong>Each line of input file corresponds to a query which is in the format:

  <ul>

   <li><em>&lt;Operator&gt;</em><em>&lt;</em>SPACE<em>&gt; </em><em>&lt;Operand 1&gt;</em><em>&lt;</em>SPACE<em>&gt; </em><em>&lt;Operand 2 if required&gt; </em> Operator can be one of the strings: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, SQRT, ABS, POW Operand will be String representing a floating point decimal number.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>For each query, you have to print a single lined output in Output.txt which is also a string corresponding to floating point decimal number.</li>

 <li>You need to handle the cases where the operand or results are negative values.</li>

 <li>Please refer to sample input files with corresponding output files for further details.</li>

 <li>For floating point results the precision should be correct up to 20 digits after decimal point.</li>

</ul>
